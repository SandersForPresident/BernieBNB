## About
BernieBNB is a home-sharing app to help out-of-town volunteers find lodging for the Bernie Sanders Democratic Primary campaign. As the convention is now over, we are no longer maintaining this project. Thank you to everyone involved. We served people across the country who helped make a difference.

## Contributing
We have a channel on slack. Please e-mail buddhistsforbernie@gmail.com for an invite.
We would love your help.
